comiss_score_content: "<h1>PURPOSE</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The CoMiSS<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;is a simple, fast and easy-to-use awareness tool for non-IgE mediated cows' milk-related symptoms. It increases awareness of the most common symptoms of cows' milk allergy (CMA) that in turn can aid an earlier diagnosis. CoMiSS<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;can also be used to evaluate and quantify the evolution of symptoms during a therapeutic intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>THE CoMiSS<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;SCORING</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The CoMiSS<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;score ranges from 0 to 33.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach symptom has a maximal score of six, with the exception of respiratory symptoms (maximal score of three).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn arbitrary cut-off value of ≥12 was selected as the criterion to pick up infants at risk of CMA. A score of 12 requires the presence of at least two severe symptoms and a score higher than 12 requires the presence of at least three symptoms and the involvement of two organ systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPublished data using the CoMiSS in clinical trials show that the predictive value of the tool is 80% if the score is &gt;12 at the start and decreases to &lt; 6 within 2 weeks under an elimination diet with an extensiviley hydrolysed formula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CoMiSS<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;is not a diagnostic tool. CMA diagnosis can only be confirmed by an elimination diet followed by an oral food challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>THE CoMiSS<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;SCORING FORM</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Now rate the observed/reported symptoms by choosing the most appropriate score for each type of symptom or download the blank scoring form.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />"
