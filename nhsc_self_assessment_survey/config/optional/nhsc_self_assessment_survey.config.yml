To fight a lack of energy, there’s no silver bullet but good diet and lifestyle habits can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DRINK PLENTY OF WATER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we don't drink enough water, we can feel tired. Water contributes to your body's physical and cognitive functions and it's recommended that we drink at least 2 litres a day from all sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.nestlehealthscience.co.uk/asset-library/PublishingImages/health-managment/aging/self-assessment/q5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES A DAY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being physically active is easier than you think, especially if you make it “essential” and routine (just like the habit of brushing your teeth every day)! It also helps if you make it “social” such as meeting a friend for a walk each day at a regular time (come rain or shine)! Sometimes it’s hard to get started but once you do it feels great and it can contribute to making the rest of your day even better. You’ll feel more energetic and focused. Also try to do resistance / strength training exercises twice a week whether at home, at the gym or in the park!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nestlehealthscience.co.uk/health-management/healthy-aging/adults-50plus\">Discover more about Maintaining Mobility here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GET A GOOD NIGHT’S SLEEP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a calming bedtime ritual and regular time to go to sleep. Avoid having disturbing lighting (e.g. reading on a tablet) or noise that can impact your sleep cycle. Keep your bedroom cool; most people sleep better in a slightly cool room versus overly warm one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EAT A BALANCED, VARIED DIET FOCUSED ON FOOD AND BEVERAGES THAT DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY PROTEIN AND WHICH ARE A SOURCE OF VITAMINS AND MINERALS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food gives your body energy to power your day.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Experts indicate that aging adults need 1.0 to 1.2 grams of protein per kilo of body weight per day. (I.e. if you weigh 60 kilos, you need 60 - 72g of protein a day.) One average size egg contains 6-7 grams of protein. Protein should ideally be consumed as part of each meal.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nestlehealthscience.co.uk/health-management/healthy-aging/protein\">Learn more about the importance of protein.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Eat a balanced and varied diet.

Feelings of fatigue accumulate. Keep your weight in check by eating a balanced diet focused on moderate portions, and enjoying at least 30 minutes of daily physical activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nestlehealthscience.co.uk/health-management/healthy-aging/health-allies\">Learn more about Allies of Aging</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MANAGE YOUR STRESS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stress can play a role in fatigue as it causes your body to pump out&nbsp;hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline,&nbsp;which also impact memory and&nbsp;thinking. To combat stress, take time for yourself or seek out pleasing social&nbsp;engagement. It is well-known that&nbsp;time with a good friend, family or your pet can put you at ease and put the brakes on stress.</p>\r\n"
